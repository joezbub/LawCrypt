Secret Sharing for Attorney-Client Documents in a Multi-Provider Cloud Architecture

In order to protect sensitvie legal information in the Cloud, I developed an architecture to pursue sophisticated privacy policies, including simultaneous authenticity, confidentiality, and unlinkability between clients and cloud providers. My website fulfills this criteria in an efficient and usable environment. My website uploads to these commonly used cloud providers: Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive. It uses ChaCha20-Poly1305 as the authentication encryption construction and secret sharing to split the original document into fragments.
